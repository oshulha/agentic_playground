Here are today’s top 3 papers in your field (e.g. NLP, ML, CV):

1. *“Self-Aligning LLMs with Minimal Human Feedback”*  
*Summary:* Proposes a lightweight framework for aligning large language models using synthetic feedback instead of RLHF.  
*Why it matters:* Reduces alignment cost by 80% while maintaining performance — a game-changer for smaller labs.

2. *“Chain-of-Backprop: Reasoning Through Differentiable Memory”*  
*Summary:* Introduces a neural architecture that combines reasoning chains with differentiable memory for complex multi-step tasks.  
*Why it matters:* Outperforms standard CoT (Chain-of-Thought) prompting on math and planning benchmarks.

3. *“Emergent Behaviors in LLMs via Sparse Reward Fine-Tuning”*  
*Summary:* Shows that rare but well-targeted reward signals can induce abstract behavior generalization in GPT-style models.  
*Why it matters:* Opens new directions for efficient model tuning with limited data and feedback.
